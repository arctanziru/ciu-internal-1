Fragments of the Forgotten

An attacker successfully deleted critical files from our system, but we managed to retrieve a partial disk image containing fragments of the deleted files. We know that critical information is stored in one of these deleted files.

However, thereâ€™s one problem: the attacker applied additional manipulations to make the analysis much harder. The flag is hidden in one of the recovered files, but you must carefully reconstruct the fragments and uncover the hidden pattern within.

FLAG : CIU2025{J4Ngan_takut_d3n6an_f0r3ns1c}
